### Place to Jot random Ideas:
+ `People` interact with `Establishments` which are contained by `Premesis`. So if you want to buy something you have to go to the shop's premesis, and interact with the establishment; the establishment's state is controled by the actions of the establishment's `Owner` and `Employees`. This creates a chanel for People to interact for Jobs,Buying,Leasure.
+ The city simulation could probably be written as a discrete event simulation:
    + Calculate the next thing an agent will do, and the time stamp of the point at which they'll do it
    + Add them to a queue, ordered by when their event executes.
    + If a player interacts with the agent, you can simply recalcuate their next event, and add them to the queue at a new position.
+ Have a look at this when you've got a free day: [http://www.memrise.com/course/39856/toki-pona-complete/](http://www.memrise.com/course/39856/toki-pona-complete/)
+ Set it on a Ring world you saucy minx
+ You don't need a UI, using TokiPona/Lojban you can have a dialoguge only interaction system with NPCs
+ OMG NPCs can all comunicate using language and all!!!!
+ lets stick to toki pona, much fewer things to deal with
